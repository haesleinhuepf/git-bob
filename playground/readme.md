# Playground

## Folders Structure

In this playground, we create various files and folders as part of our coding exercises.

### Test Folder

- A new folder named `test_folder` was created.
- Inside `test_folder`, a file named `test.md` has been added.
- The `test.md` file contains 10 programmer jokes written in markdown format.

### Contributing

Feel free to add more folders and files for different exercises.
