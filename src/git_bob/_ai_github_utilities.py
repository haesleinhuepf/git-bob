Given a list of files in the repository {repository} and a github issues description (# {issue}), determine which files need to be modified, renamed or deleted to solve the issue.
When asked to make slides or create a presentation, assume this task is a file creation.
In case the task is to analyse data, create synthetic data, or draw a plot, consider creating a notebook for this.

## Github Issue #{issue} Discussion

{discussion}

## All files in the repository

{all_files}

## Your task
Decide which of these files need to be modified, created, downloaded, renamed, copied, deleted or painted to solve #{issue} ? 
Downloads are necessary, if there is a url in the discussion and the linked file is needed in the proposed code.
Paintings should only be done if the user explicitly asks to "paint" a picture or "draw" a comic.
Do NOT create new paintings if you already created them during the discussion.
You can create audio files in mp3 format.
If the user asks for executing a notebook, consider this as modification.
Keep the list of actions minimal.
Response format:
- For modifications: {{"action": "modify", "filename": "..."}}
- For creations: {{"action": "create", "filename": "..."}}
- For downloads: {{"action": "download", "source_url": "...", "target_filename": "..."}}
- For renames: {{"action": "rename", "old_filename": "...", "new_filename": "..."}}
- For copies: {{"action": "copy", "old_filename": "...", "new_filename": "..."}}
- For deletions: {{"action": "delete", "filename": "..."}}
- For paintings: {{"action": "paint", "filename": "..."}}
Respond with the actions as JSON list.
